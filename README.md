# EV3 Chess Player

The EV3 Chess Player, built using Lego Mindstorms EV3 and programmed in RobotC, was created for the University of Waterloo Mechatronics Engineering 1A Course Project (MTE 100 / GENE 121).

Basic functionalities of the system include picking up and placing chess pieces on a chess board, receiving user input from the EV3 brick, checking for move validity, check, checkmate, and stalemate, chess board setup and reset, and replaying the previously played match.
